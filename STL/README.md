Some STL model files related to the Anycubic I3 printer

The inductive probe holder is meant to hold a LJ12A3-4-Z/BX or BY proximity sensor, the 18mm version has been added for LJ18 sensors. The R-Version is modified for a screw fit from rear if using the angeled mount. 

All parts are a bit tight by design so they need some treatment after print to fit them to the printers tolerances. 

It is very important to take care that the sensor is exact in right angle to the build plate, even more for the 12mm sensor that is very sensible to a tiny deviation.

Due to the mount position above the hotend the probe mount is affected by temerature, probing cold to hot can easily drift like  +-0.1mm. 

The rubber foot printed in TPU/TPE is working quite well as vibration damper. Six prints are needed, infill like 20-30%, depending on the material. The damper shall hold the weight of the printer with only very little bending to enable the internal structure to absorb the vibrations that occur in operation.
