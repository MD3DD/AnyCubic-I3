The source firmware is a Marlin 1.0 version from late 2014. It usually comes with the printer on SD card and
is provided here as is because from user reports it in some cases didnt make it onto the card. 

Included are the hardware librarys for Arduino to support the Arduino Mega hardware and need be added to the 
Arduino hardware folder.

The firmware is not identical with the one that comes preinstalled on the printer board, it is an early version
and does not support the "Resume from power outage" feature. Though, it already comes with Bed AutoLevel support.

The Anycubic Prusa I3 - as I received it - with the Trigorilla Ramps 1.4 Controller board (Mainboard 33) was 
meant to control the second Z motor from the E1 connector. For the source firmware it either has to be plugged
to the secondary Z connector or in Configuration_adv.h the Z_DUAL_STEPPER_DRIVERS has to be defined.

For me the firmware worked out of the box but I would not recommend to upload it to the printer unless the 
procedure how to reupload the manufacturers firmware - provided as .hex-file on SD card - is familiar. For 
an unmodified printer this firmware does not provide any benefit compared to the preinstalled version.
