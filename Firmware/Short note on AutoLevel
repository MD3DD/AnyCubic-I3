With aluminium hotbed and an inductive probe it is possible to add Autolevel capabilities to the printer. 

The inductive Probe - LJ12A3-Z/BX as sold by Anycubic (BY should do as well) in reality on aluminium has
a detection range of like 2mm. So even if it is possible to run it with a glass covered hotbed using some
aluminium foil applied to the probing spots, this limits leveling to 3 or 4 spots at the cost of some build
space. For a tape covered aluminium build plate this probe works well, should also do with Buildtak or similiar.

A sample probe holder that mounts to lefthand position on the X carriage is provided in STL directory. The 
straight version is a bit tight with the X endstop connector, the angled version works well with that, but the
holders screw notch still is in the wrong side for that. Well.

http://www.instructables.com/id/Enable-Auto-Leveling-for-your-3D-Printer-Marlin-Fi/ provides a nice guide how
to install and wire the probe and configure the Autolevel-feature in Firmware.

My settings in Configuration.h are:
#define ENABLE_AUTO_BED_LEVELING 
  // these are the positions on the bed to do the probing
  #define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 15
  #define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 170
  #define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION 170
  #define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 20

  // these are the offsets to the prob relative to the extruder tip (Hotend - Probe)
  #define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -29
  #define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 0
  #define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -1.2
  
   #define PROBE_SERVO_DEACTIVATION_DELAY 0

If compiling the firmware with Autolevel enabled results in a "time.h not found" error, the Time library from
Paul Stoffregen installed in the normal libraries folder, in qr_solve.cpp time.h changed to Time.h solves this
issue. (Fork of this library available at https://github.com/duisenberg/Time)

I wired the probe a little different as shown in the instructable. The probe triggers a tiny Reed Relais that
is connected parallel to the mechanical Z enstop. So in case the probe fails,  the mechanical endstop still is
in place to prevent the nozzle from crashing into the bed.  It is adjusted to trigger a tiny bit lower than the
inductive probe. 

Anyway, there is a big caveat with the Marlin 1.0 Firmware provided with the printer: AutoLevel simply does not
work. After G29 XY positioning runs to a random offset per move, resulting in funny spirals instead of a circle. 
After G28XY positioning works expected, but ... Autolevel grid is gone.

The only real cure here is to get Marlin 1.0.2 or a later stable release, edit the configs to match with the 
Anycubic config and then Autolevel works a bit more as expected.

I would not recommend to use the Anycubic Inductive probe ... maybe other inductives will fail as well. First issue
with them is they are not temperature compensated what means up to 0.5mm difference in detection range depending on
the temperature of the hotbed. If the hotbed happens to be on while probing, this again affects the detection range.
No surprise with inductive probe. 

A capacitive probe might work better, also is said to work with glass bed. But for the available devices the form 
factor - 18mm diameter and more - is quite odd, a mechanical switch with servo isnt much worse.

From handling the 1.0.2 Marlin is not really ideal too. Babystepping in a print would help to adjust the temperature
offset that has to be compensated, but the value isnt shown on display (Reprap smart discount) and so turning the 
thumbwheel is a bit of a blind flight. 

So all in all - the AutoLevel feature did not meet expectaions yet. Maybe Marlin 1.1.0 will work better.
